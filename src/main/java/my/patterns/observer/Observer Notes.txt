Java has its own Observer Class and Observable Class

Subject -> Observable

 addObserver(Observer o)
 clearChanged()
 countObservers()
 deleteObserver(Observer o)
 deleteObservers() 
 hasChanged() 
 notifyObservers() 
 notifyObservers(Object arg)
 setChanged()


Observer
	void update(Observable o, Object arg)  
	
	
	The problem with the Java Observer is that the Observable Object reference is sent as the parameter.
	So the object might get locked or the Observer can access all the information, though its not necessary
