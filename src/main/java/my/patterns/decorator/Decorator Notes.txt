Closed for Modification, Open for Extension

1) A Computer class has a method description() which returns " A computer"
2) To add to this description "and a montior" and "and a hard disk", we would need to modify the class
Solution:
 1) Create an interface [Interface cannot extend a class, so use an abstract class instead] ComponentDecorator and make it extend the Computer class as the Decorator Objects will need to be held by the same objects as Computer class
 public abstract class ComponentDecorator extends Computer {
   public abstract String description();
 }
 
 2) Use the has-a relationship in each of its implementations to drive the Decoration added
 
 public class Disk extends ComponentDecorator {
   Computer computer;
   public Disk(Computer c) {
     computer = c;
   }
   public String description(){
     return c.description() + " and a Disk";
   }
   
   
3) Java stream classes are decorators
